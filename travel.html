            <p>Chicago is a fun place to visit every so often, however, I would not want to live there.</p>
            </div>

            <p>My hometown is about 30 miles northwest of Chicago, so I have been there quite a few times. With as many fun experiences I have had in the city, I have also had my fair share of not-so-fun experiences. Most of them involve using the Chicago public transportation system.</p>

            <p>Ann Arbor, Michigan is a beautiful city. I had never considered applying to the University of Michigan until I visited my friend that went here when I was a sophomore at my community college in Illinois. I instantly fell in love with the city and was thrilled when I was accepted into the school. I love this town and will be sad to leave it one day.</p>
