            <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p> 
            </div>

            <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>

            <img src="images/buff_bean.jpg" width = "400" alt="Orange cat wearing a blue harness and looking offended">

            <p>Bean Bear is a 1 year old short haired tabby. He may not be as vocal as his brother, Sprout Jr., when he wants attention, but he is a very needy boy. If someone is showing Sprout Jr. too much attention, he will get jealous. He is a very emotional cat, and will also get embarrassed if he falls or misses a jump. Make sure to give Bean lots of butt smacks and do not stop until he's satisfied, not even if your arm gets tired.</p>

            <p>Sprout Jr. is a 1 year old short haired tabby. He is very vocal when he wants attention, and will either yell at you, or bite your leg if he feels ignored. His favorite place to hang out is in the kitchen in someone's lap as they sit criss-cross applesauce on the floor. He loves to watch people cook dinner and be loved on while doing so. At night, he likes to sit on people's laps or legs if they are wearing a blanket. He will sit in your lap until your legs fall asleep, but do not get up or you will hurt his feelings.</p>

            <p>Matzah is a 6 year old tabby cat. She is very chill and laid back, but will sometimes surprise you with her bursts of energy. She is not very vocal until she is at a closed door and wants it to be open. She does not like to be touched on her butt or her back feet. She will not sit on the couch unless there is no one else in the room with her.</p>
